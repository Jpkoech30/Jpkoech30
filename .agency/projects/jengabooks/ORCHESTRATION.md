# 🧠 JengaBooks Mobile — Orchestration

> **Status:** `ACTIVE` | **Project:** `jengabooks` | **Created:** 2026-07-10 | **Updated:** 2026-07-11
> **Agency context:** Root [`ORCHESTRATION.md`](../../ORCHESTRATION.md) tracks agency-level infrastructure sprints (S5+).
> **This file** tracks only JengaBooks-specific feature sprints (S1-S4).

## 📋 Project Overview

**Goal:** Transform the JengaBooks mobile app from a basic MVP into a feature-complete, offline-first, production-ready mobile companion aligned with the [Feature Spec v3.0](plans/mobile-feature-spec-delta.md). **Now incorporating ALL Simple Invoice Manager (SIM) features** — the #1 invoicing app (5M+ downloads, 4.7★) — plus Kenyan additions (M-Pesa, eTIMS, practice management).

**Core Promise:** *"Compliance Made Effortless. Financial Management Made Clear."*

**Key Differentiators (from Spec §2):**
- Native M-Pesa integration with auto-sync
- Built-in eTIMS/KRA compliance
- Mobile-first with offline capability
- Accountant practice management
- Local language support (English/Swahili)
- **SIM-Powered:** 10+ professional invoice templates, one-click duplicate, signed receipts, credit notes, product portfolio, CSV export, barcode scanning, multi-currency

**Current State:** 6 tab screens, 15 components, basic auth/sync/infrastructure.

**Target Architecture:** See [`plans/mobile-architecture-overview.md`](plans/mobile-architecture-overview.md)

**Delta Analysis:** See [`plans/mobile-feature-spec-delta.md`](plans/mobile-feature-spec-delta.md) — full mapping of Feature Spec v3.0 → sprint plan

**SIM Gap Analysis:** See [§10 in delta analysis](plans/mobile-feature-spec-delta.md#10-simple-invoice-manager-sim-feature-gap-analysis) — SIM's top 14 most-praised features mapped to sprint plan

## 🎨 Design Principles — Embedded in Every Sprint

All sprints enforce our 12 core design principles from Feature Spec v3.0 (§3). Each task maps to at least one principle:

| # | Principle | Definition | Enforcement Gate |
|---|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| **DP1** | **Mobile-First** | Mobile experience as powerful as desktop. No "mobile web" compromises. | All screens must be built/tested on mobile first |
| **DP2** | **Single-Screen Completion** | Complete tasks on one screen. Minimize navigation and keyboard input. | No multi-step wizards; modals over new screens |
| **DP3** | **Adaptive UI** | Show only relevant fields. Hide complexity until needed. | Role-based defaults; progressive disclosure |
| **DP4** | **Simple ≠ Limited** | "Simple" describes UX, not feature set. Support complex scenarios simply. | Feature-dense but visually clean |
| **DP5** | **Brand Customization** | Logo, signature, templates, accent colors. User expresses identity. | Every screen supports branding |
| **DP6** | **Frictionless Sharing** | One-tap sharing via WhatsApp, email, and shareable links. | Share button on every generated entity |
| **DP7** | **Focus Without Interference** | Interface is an unobtrusive backdrop. Users focus on work, not software. | Minimal chrome, max content area |
| **DP8** | **Clarity & Confidence** | Every action and state must be unambiguous. Green/Yellow/Red status. | Status badges on all stateful entities |
| **DP9** | **Clean & Intuitive** | "Unbelievably clean" and "easy to navigate." FreshBooks-level polish. | Consistent spacing, typography, iconography |
| **DP10** | **Localized, Not Translated** | Built for Kenya, not "global software with Swahili translation." | Swahili + Plain English toggles; KSh default; DD/MM/YYYY |
| **DP11** | **Compliance-First** | eTIMS, KRA, and statutory requirements are built in, not bolted on. | eTIMS status on every invoice |
| **DP12** | **Offline Capable** | Work without internet; sync when online. Zero data loss. | WatermelonDB for all critical data |
| **DP13** | **Autosave** | No "Save" button. Changes auto-saved as user types. | All forms implement on-change auto-persist |
| **DP14** | **Progressive Disclosure** | Hide complexity until needed. Advanced options behind "More" expander. | Collapsible sections for non-essential fields |
| **DP15** | **Visual Data Representation** | Charts, graphs, sparklines for financial insights. | KPIs rendered as visual widgets, not tables |
| **DP16** | **Clear Status Indicators** | Green/Yellow/Red health dots, confidence badges, compliance shields. | Every entity with a status gets a badge |

**Every task in every sprint references its governing design principles.** Code review must verify each principle was implemented.

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### Current Architecture
```
Expo Router (file-based routing)
  └── 6 tab screens (index, ledger, etims, hitl, reports, settings)
  └── Zustand stores (auth, ui)
  └── Axios API client (JWT interceptor, refresh rotation)
  └── In-memory offline cache (placeholder)
  └── Simple polling sync (30s interval)
```

### Target Architecture (Sprint 3 completion)
```
Expo Router (file-based routing)
  ├── 16+ screen routes (see File Structure below)
  ├── Zustand stores (auth, ui, sync, company, notifications, language)
  ├── WatermelonDB (local-first offline database)
  │   ├── Sync protocol with API backend
  │   ├── Optimistic updates + conflict resolution
  │   └── Pull-based sync on foreground + push-based via socket
  ├── Axios API client (JWT interceptor, refresh rotation, retry queue)
  ├── Socket.io (real-time updates, live sync events)
  ├── Expo Push Notifications
  ├── Expo Secure Store (auth tokens + biometric keys)
  ├── expo-sharing / react-native-share (WhatsApp + email sharing)
  └── i18n engine (Plain English + Swahili toggles)
```

### Key Constraints (from [`PROJECT.md`](../../projects/jengabooks/PROJECT.md))
- **48px minimum touch targets** on all interactive elements
- **fontSize: 16** on all mobile inputs to prevent iOS zoom
- **No in-memory state** for financial data (must use WatermelonDB/local persistence)
- **JWT is the sole session state** (no Redis sessions)
- **Tenant isolation** on all queries

## 🚨 Known Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| WatermelonDB schema conflicts with Prisma schema | Data loss | Design sync protocol before coding, map fields explicitly |
| Poor offline UX on slow networks | User drop-off | Loading skeletons, optimistic updates, retry queue |
| Push notification setup complexity | Delayed delivery | Start Expo Push setup early |
| iOS keyboard covering inputs | Bad UX | KeyboardAvoidingView + scrollToInput on all form screens |
| Expo SDK 51 compatibility with WatermelonDB latest | Build errors | Pin WatermelonDB version, test on both platforms |
| WhatsApp sharing API restrictions (iOS) | Blocked sharing | Use `expo-sharing` as fallback + `react-native-share` |
| Biometric auth on simulator | Broken dev flow | Feature-flag biometric; allow PIN fallback in dev |
| Swahili translation quality | User distrust | Use native Swahili speakers for review, not machine translation |
| Invoice aging calculation with offline data | Inaccurate reports | Calculate from WatermelonDB local data, reconcile on sync |
| SIM Feature #2: 10+ invoice templates increase APK size | App bloat | Lazy-load template previews; serve template thumbnails from CDN |
| SIM Feature #5: Client contact history storage offline | Lost comms history | Store contact events in WatermelonDB; sync on reconnect |
| SIM Feature #8: Credit notes linked to invoices — cascading state | Financial inconsistency | Server-side validation prevents over-crediting; mobile shows remaining balance |
| SIM Feature #9: Signed receipt PDF generation on mobile | Performance hit on slow devices | Generate receipt PDFs server-side; mobile only triggers and downloads |
| SIM Feature #10: Combined payments (CASH + MPESA + CARD) | Split payment reconciliation | Each payment leg recorded separately; invoice status computed from all legs |
| SIM Feature #11: CSV export of large datasets (10k+ rows) | Mobile memory crash | Stream CSV generation server-side; mobile downloads pre-generated file |
| SIM Feature #12: Bulk client import from phonebook | Duplicate contacts, privacy | Server-side dedup on email/phone; user confirms before import |
| SIM Feature #13: Multi-currency — exchange rate volatility | Inaccurate reporting | Daily exchange rate cache; show both original and base currency |
| SIM Feature #14: Barcode scanner camera permission | App store rejection | Graceful fallback to manual SKU entry; request permission only on scan action |
