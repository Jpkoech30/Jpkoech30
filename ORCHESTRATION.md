## 🚨 Sprint MP — Critical Infrastructure Patches

> **Status:** `IN PROGRESS` | **Lead:** 🧠 Lead Architect & Orchestrator | **Created:** 2026-07-11
> **Priority:** CRITICAL
> **Plan:** [`.agency/plans/critical-patches-plan.md`](.agency/plans/critical-patches-plan.md)

### Problem Summary

Two critical issues were identified during agency setup review:

1. **Patch 1 — Project Switching Mismatch:** `.agency/.active-project` contains `zoocode-agency` (legacy) while `.agency/projects.json` declares `activeProject: "jengabooks"`. The `cmdRegister()` function in [`projects-manager.js`](.agency/scripts/projects-manager.js) does not update `.active-project`, and [`init-project.js`](.agency/scripts/init-project.js) does not create it at all.

2. **Patch 2 — FileRegex Overlap (Swarm Rule #5):** `frontend-web` has `apps/web/src/` which is a parent of `frontend-ui`'s `apps/web/src/components/`, `frontend-page`'s `apps/web/src/pages/`, and `frontend-state`'s sub-paths. Same issue with `frontend-mobile` vs mobile specialists. Also `packages/shared/src/` is claimed by both `frontend-web` and `backend-logic`.

### Sprint MP Task Board

| # | Task | Type | Agent | Est. | Status | Depends On | Plan Ref |
|---|------|------|-------|------|--------|------------|----------|
| **MP-1** | Sync `.active-project` + fix `cmdRegister()` + `init-project.js` | `script-fix` | 🔧 JengaBooks Code | 0.5d | ✅ `DONE` | — | §Patch 1 |
| **MP-2** | Fix agent fileRegex overlaps in `.roomodes` | `config-fix` | 🔧 JengaBooks Code | 0.5d | ✅ `DONE` | — | §Patch 2 |

### Sprint 11 — Pre-Flight Gate Enforcement (Est. 3 days)
> **Status:** `IN_PROGRESS` | **Lead:** 🧠 Lead Architect | **Contract:** `agency-preflight-gate@1.0.0`
> **Priority:** CRITICAL — Fixes the fundamental protocol compliance gap
> **Plan:** [`.agency/plans/pfg-implementation-plan.md`](.agency/plans/pfg-implementation-plan.md)
>
> **Problem:** The pre-task oath at AGENCY-RULES.md §42 is voluntary. No agent can be forced to follow it — proven by the Lead Architect skipping it on the first turn of this session.
>
> **Solution:** 3-layer enforcement system that makes the oath technically unskippable.

| # | Task | Type | Agent | Est. | Status | Depends On | Contract |
|---|------|------|-------|------|--------|------------|----------|
| **11.1** | Create `.agency/scripts/preflight-gate.js` — 4 commands (pass/check/reset/status) with sentinel file | `script` | 🔧 JengaBooks Code | 1d | ✅ `DONE` | — | `agency-preflight-gate@1.0.0` |

Use `node .agency/scripts/update-roomodes.js` approach to widen `code-agent` or `devops` regex to include extensionless config files. | `config-fix` | 🔧 JengaBooks Code | 0.25d | ✅ `DONE` | — | — |

### Sprint 11 Task Details

| # | Task | Design Principles | Edge Cases |
|---|------|-------------------|------------|
| **11.1** | **preflight-gate.js** — Node script with 4 commands. Sentinel file at `.agency/.preflight-passed` stores agent slug, timestamp, task, oathHash. Calls telemetry.js for event logging. | None (infra) | Sentinel corrupted → fail-safe exit 1; Parallel agents → slug matching; Hotfix → --hotfix flag bypasses sentinel check |
| **11.2** | **Inject PFG oath in .roomodes** — For each of 31 agents, prepend to customInstructions: `"CRITICAL — FIRST ACTION: You MUST recite the pre-task oath from AGENCY-RULES.md v5.0 §PRE-TASK OATH BEFORE executing ANY tool. Output: \"🧠 Bound by AGENCY-RULES v5.0. Pre-flight passed. Cost estimate: ~X,XXX tokens (~KES Y.YY). Sections: [applicable sections].\" Then run: node .agency/scripts/preflight-gate.js pass --agent <slug> --task \"<brief description>\".\n\n"` | None (config) | Preserve ALL existing customInstructions content after line 1 |
| **11.3** | **validate-commit.js update** — Add `PREFLIGHT` to optional fields. Advisory warning (non-blocking) if missing. | None (config) | CI/CD commits may not have PREFLIGHT; use NOT_REQUIRED value |
| **11.4** | **Gitignore update** — Add `.agency/.preflight-passed` | None (config) | Ensure file is in correct location |
| **11.6** | **Fix .roomodes fileRegex gap** — No agent can edit `.roomodes` because it has no file extension. Options: (a) Add `code-agent` regex to include files without extension in root; (b) Create a `config-editor` agent with `.*` regex for config files; (c) Add loose regex to `devops` or `release-manager`. | None (config) | Must not create security loophole (wildcard regex) |

### Handoff Chain

| Handoff | From | To | Artifacts |
|---------|------|----|-----------|
| **H11.0** | 🧠 Lead Architect | 🔧 JengaBooks Code | Fix .roomodes fileRegex accessibility + implement PFG script + inject oaths |
| **H11.1** | 🔧 JengaBooks Code | 🧪 QA Automator | All PFG artifacts for validation |
| **H11.2** | 🧪 QA Automator | 🧠 Lead Architect | PFG validation report — all 7 gates (PFG-G1 through PFG-G7) PASS |

### Quality Gates

| Gate | Trigger | Pass Criteria |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **PFG-G1** | 11.1 complete | `node preflight-gate.js pass` → `.preflight-passed` exists with valid JSON |
| **PFG-G2** | 11.1 complete | After pass → `node preflight-gate.js check --agent X` → exit 0 |
| **PFG-G3** | 11.1 complete | After reset → `node preflight-gate.js check --agent X` → exit 1 |
| **PFG-G4** | 11.1 complete | Sentinel with agent=A → `check --agent B` → exit 1 |
| **PFG-G5** | 11.1 complete | Telemetry contains `preflight-gate:pass` event |
| **PFG-G6** | 11.2 complete | Every mode in .roomodes has PFG instruction as `customInstructions[0]` |
| **PFG-G7** | 11.6 complete | At least one agent's fileRegex matches `.roomodes` filename |

### Sprint 12 — ORCHESTRATION.md Per-Project Split (Principal 14 Compliance)
> **Status:** `PLANNED` | **Lead:** 🧠 Lead Architect | **Plan:** [`.agency/plans/orch-split-plan.md`](.agency/plans/orch-split-plan.md)
> **Priority:** HIGH — Root ORCHESTRATION.md violates Principal 14 by mixing agency + jengabooks content
>
> **Problem:** Root ORCHESTRATION.md contains BOTH agency-level sprints (S5-S11, MP) AND jengabooks-specific sprints (S1-S4). Per Principal 14.7, each project must have its own ORCHESTRATION.md in `.agency/projects/<id>/`.

| # | Task | Type | Agent | Est. | Status | Files |
|---|------|------|-------|------|--------|-------|

### Sprint 14 — Post-Task Gate Enforcement (Est. 2 days)

> **Plan:** [`.agency/plans/ptg-implementation-plan.md`](.agency/plans/ptg-implementation-plan.md)
> **Priority:** CRITICAL — Sprint 13 proved PFG only enforces task START, not task END

### Sprint 14 Task Details

| # | Task | Edge Cases |
|---|------|------------|
| **14.1** | **post-task-gate.js** — 4 checkpoints. `--task` and `--agent` required. Outputs pass/fail per checkpoint. Telemetry logged. | CI mode → --ci flag skips non-blocking checks; Hotfix → --hotfix allows partial pass |
| **14.2** | **handoff.js integration** — `handoff()` calls `post-task-gate.js check` before updating ORCHESTRATION.md. If PTG fails → exit 1, no handoff. | First handoff (no prior history) → PTG skipped; Already-checked flag → don't re-check |

### Quality Gates

| Gate | Trigger | Pass Criteria |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **PTG-G1** | 14.1 complete | PTG-C1 passes after memory.js store, fails without |
| **PTG-G2** | 14.1 complete | PTG-C2 passes with clean dir, fails with temp files |
| **PTG-G3** | 14.1 complete | PTG-C3 passes with valid commit msg, fails without MEMORY |
| **PTG-G4** | 14.1 complete | PTG-C4 resets sentinel automatically |
| **PTG-G5** | 14.1 complete | Full workflow passes end-to-end |
| **PTG-G6** | 14.2 complete | handoff.js blocks when PTG check fails |

### Handoff Chain

| Handoff | From | To | Artifacts |
|---------|------|----|-----------|
| **H14.0** | 🧠 Lead Architect | 🔧 JengaBooks Code | Sprint 14 tasks 14.1-14.2 |
| **H14.1** | 🔧 JengaBooks Code | 🧪 QA Automator | PTG artifacts for validation |
